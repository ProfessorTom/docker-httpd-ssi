* `docker-httpd-ssi`

Simple Docker build for SSI-enabled Apache (since I got sick of OS X/macOS breaking my configuration on every OS upgrade).

Based on the stock ~httpd~ on Alpine Linux: I've marked the changes to ~httpd.conf~ with the comment ~**SSI**~.

Build with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  docker build -t cassiel/httpd-ssi .
#+END_SRC

(if you want; it is already in [[https://hub.docker.com/r/cassiel/httpd-ssi/][Docker Hub]]).

Run with:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  docker run -it --name cassiel/httpd-ssi -p 5000:80 -v "$PWD":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd-ssi
#+END_SRC

(changing port, target directory etc. according to taste).
